    <h1> Implications</h1>
<ul>
<li>
    Aesthetics
    <ul>
        <li>aesthetics is important because a good looking main character in a video game is what draws people to the game
            & is usually what people think of first when thinking about the game </li>
        <li> I will ensure it looks good by asking peoples opinions & gatheing a range of different viewpoints
            on whether or not it is visually appealing & adjust it until i am happy with the result
        </li>    
    </ul>
</li>
<li>
    Functionality
    <ul>
        <li>Functionality is important because if the character isnt able to move at all then
            there isnt much reason to use it</li> 
     <li> i will ensure it is able to move, jump, walk, & run without visual issues at least by testing if the movement works correctly by 
        moving each limb & joint around & checking if anything unexpected happens
     </li>       
    </ul>
        <li>   
            Usability
            <ul>
                <li>Usability is important because if you can't use it then there isn't much
                    reason to have it because well, its useless
                </li>
                <li>i will achieve this by asking people to test it & see if they can use it for various things</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
