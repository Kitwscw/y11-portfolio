   <h2>Task 1: warning</h2>
   <p>i made a simple warning that said a lot of the
    major parts of the game were quite violent &amp; asked the user
    if they still wanted to play the game knowing this
   </p>
   <img class="rounded-edges" src="warning-screenshot.png" alt="warning for game">
   <h3>testing</h3>
   <p>im testing to see if the program will recognise that i said yes
    &amp; print the phrase "the game"
   </p>
   <img class="rounded-edges" src="warning-test1.png">
   <p>
    now im testing if it will print the phrase 
    "sorry you didnt wanna play the game i guess" 
    if i say anything other than yes

   <h2>Task 2: Intro</h2>
   <p>the maority of this task is writing in the traditional 
    sense rather than in the coding sense so the testing will just be 
    my opinion
   </p>
   <h3>development:</h3>
   <p>i wrote a simple introduction that i think fits the theme im going for</p>

   <h3>testing:</h3>
   <p>i think it is pretty good & is written well,
    i quite like what ive done with this but i think it has a few 
    spelling mistakes 
   </p>
