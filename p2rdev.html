   <h2>Task 1: warning</h2>
   <p>i made a simple warning that said a lot of the
    major parts of the game were quite violent &AMP; asked the user
    if they still wanted to play the game knowing this
   </p>
   <img class="rounded-edges" src="warning-screenshot.png" alt="warning for game">
   <h3>testing</h3>
   <p>im testing to see if the program will recognise that i said yes
    &AMP; print the phrase "the game"
   </p>
   <img class="rounded-edges" src="warning-test1.png">
   <p>
    now im testing if it will print the phrase 
    "sorry you didnt wanna play the game i guess" 
    if i say anything other than yes
   </p>

   <h3>Feedback:</h3>
   <h4>What do you think needs to be added/removed?</h4>
   <p>"I think the ampersands should be replaced with the word and"</p>
   <p>"I think you shpould add that none of the actions in the game 
    shuld be replicated"
   </p>
   <h3>Improvements:</h3>
   <p>I changed the ampersands to the word "and" &AMP; i added an extra disclaimer 
    saying that none of the actions should be replicated
   </p>

   <h2>Task 2: Intro</h2>
   <p>the maority of this task is writing in the traditional 
    sense rather than in the coding sense so the testing will just be 
    my opinion
   </p>
   <h3>development:</h3>
   <p>i wrote a simple introduction that i think fits the theme im going for</p>
   <img class="rounded-edges" src="w-intro.png">
   <h3>testing:</h3>
   <p>i think it is pretty good &AMP; is written well,
    i quite like what ive done with this but i think it has a few 
    spelling mistakes 
   </p>
   <h3>feedback:</h3>
   <h4>what do you think is good, &AMP; what do you think should be changed?</h4>
   <p>"have then character be looking for a way out of the woods
    rather than looking for a place to stay"
   </p>
   <p>"i noticed a few spelling &AMP; grammar mistakes, you should fix them"</p>
   <h3>Improvements:</h3>
   <p>I fixed the spelling mistakes & changed it from needing 
    shelter to needing to escape the woods
   </p>
   <h2>Task 3: Shop description</h2>
   <h3>Development</h3>
   <p>I wrote a description for the shop & the man running it, 
    I wanted him to be kind of mysterious &amp; i think i captured that 
    in my description of him
   </p>
   <img class="rounded-fit" src="shop-test1.png" alt="shop test img">
   <h3>testing:</h3>
   <p>i need to add line breaks in certain areas &amp; fix any spelling mistakes</p>
   <h3>Feedback:</h3>
   <h4>do you notice any spelling or grammar errors &amp; also is there anything you would change personally</h4>
   <p>"theres a few capitalisation &amp; grammar errors, also add a few full stops where required</p>
   <p>"add line breaks"</p>
   <h3>Improvements</h3>
   <p></p>
