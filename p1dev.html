    <h1> Task 1: Turnaround</h1>
    <img class="turnaround" src="character-turnaround.png" alt="character turnaround">
    <p>I made a simple sketch of how i want my character to look & scanned it</p>

    <h1>task 1 p1: Testing</h1>
    <p>i'm quite happy with how the sketch has turned out so far but i do think it's legs are slightly too thin
       also the scan looks weird because of the fact its drawn in pencil so ill probably 
       draw over it in pen otherwise i think its quite good </p>

       <h1>task 2 p2: Feedback</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                person 1: Sebastian
                <ul>
                    <li>I think that the side profile of the character seems to be a bit too thin, and doesn't seem to be proportional to the width of the character's front profile. I also think that the legs of the character should be a bit longer as they seem quite short, but I understand that that could be a design choice depending on what the character is.</li>

                </ul>
                <li>
                    person 2: Tristram
                    <ul>
                        <li>the waist could be wider. The singe crest on the characters torso leaves something to be desired but overall a good character idea</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </li>
        </ul>
       <h1>task 1 p3: Improvements</h1>
       <p>i gotta be honest i didnt really use the feedback but idc tbh</p>    

       <h1>task 2: torso</h1>
       <p>i honestly didnt get a screenshot while i was making the torso but i didnt run into any
        npotable issues whilst making it so here's the finished product
       </p>

       <h1>task 3:legs</h1>
       <p>again, i didnt get a screenshot whilst modelling the legs & only had an issue with my mouse dying, 
        so it didnt matter much, also i only have a picture of the torso with the legs so you're getting that
       </p>
       <img class="rounded-edges" src="legs-dev-screenshot.png" alt="legs+torso">
