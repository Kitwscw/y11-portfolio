  <ul>
    <li>
        Functionality
        <ul>
            <li>functionality means that the game actually needs 
                to work as intended
            </li>
            <li>i will adress this implication by testing all of it thoroughly
                to ensure it works as intended & adjust it if it doesnt
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Usability
        <ul>
            <li>usability mans that it is clear & easy to use</li>
            <li>i will adress this by asking multiple people to use it
                & then ask them if they think it is good to use
                then i will make adjustments based on the feedback & repeat
                this process
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>legal
        <ul>
            <li>legal is ensuring that it follows the laws of our country
                eg: intelectual property, etc
            </li>
            <li>i will adress this by writing all of the code myself & 
                only using broad concepts that cannot be confused for 
                violation of intellectual property
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>ethical
        <ul>
            <li>ethical is ensuring that it is not morally wrong &amp;
                that no one will actually do the things depicted in you game
            </li>
            <li>i will ensure that it isnt morally wrong by writing a warning
                at the start of the game saying that it is not appropriate
                for young persons & that the things described in it 
                should not be recreated
            </li>
